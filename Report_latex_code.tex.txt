    \section{Introduction}
    \qquad Each supercomputer requires...
    \newline Simulation tool to model the behaviour of the computing platform, which will be called \textit{simulation tool} in the next chapters. \newline
    \qquad The report has been divided into three, important, main sections: 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item requirement analysis (Chapter \ref{Requirements}),
        \item implementation (Chapter \ref{Implementation}),
        \item and software testing/quality assurance (Chapter \ref{STQA}).
    \end{itemize}
    \qquad In requirement analysis chapter all requirements have been presented as text and also as diagrams. This is very important part of report, because it includes a lot of detailed information. Each information weights on other part of work like: which functionality should be created by developers. In implementation chapter, the general design of code has been presented: division into classes or used patterns. In software testing/quality assurance chapter, entire documentation concerns testing has been described. However, typical documentation has another form, more practical, less scientific. Standards templates from IEEE are the best example of documentation for requirements or testing. Nevertheless, in this report only some parts from typical documentation has been used, because this report is project for assessment. So this is the reason, why each part is prelude by theory, which normally (in simple project) maybe does not exist.
    
    \newpage
    \section{Requirement Analysis} \label{Requirements}
    \qquad The requirements are description of what system shall do, which services it provides and which constraints it includes. Very important part of software design is analyzing and documenting these requirements (it is called requirements engineering) \cite{softwareEngineeringBook}.
        
    Requirements can be described on high-level abstraction, very general or more detailed. So it is possible to defined following type of requirements: 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item User requirements, which are described in natural language in general way.
        \item System requirements, which described in more detailed way functions, services, constraints. These information are important for software engineers and they can help during implementation. System requirements are based on user requirements.
    \end{enumerate}
    However, system requirements can be divided into two sub-types:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Functional requirements - what system shall do, how system shall react and also what system shall not do \cite{functionalReq}.
        \item Non-functional requirements - more critical and sometimes complicated than functional requirements. Their include: performance, security, response time etc. \cite{nonfunctionalReq}.
    \end{enumerate}
    In the next subsections, functional and non-functional requirements of simulation tool have been described. Unfortunately, sometimes division user requirements into functional and non-functional requirements is not clear-cut.
    
    All requirements have been created based on User Requirements [Appendix \ref{UserRequirements}].
        
        \subsection{Functional Requirements} %Functional requirements
        \qquad Functional requirements are presented are system features with short description at the beginning. Each system feature got priority level: Low, Medim or High.

                            \item The short job shall take up 2 nodes for no more than 1 hours and 10\% resources must be reserved for this job queue.
                            \item The medium-sized job shall take up to 10\% of total numbers of cores and can last up to 8 hours. 30\% resources shall be reserved for this job queues.

                \end{enumerate}
        \subsection{Additional information}
        \qquad During implementation of code, some questions and doubts appeared. Not everything has been described in user requirements very clearly and interpretation can be different for each person. The first thing, which is not very understandable is: can be given type of nodes used for every type of job? Thus, some requirements have been added additionally, that any doubt does not exists.
                
                
        \subsection{UML diagrams} \label{umlDiagrams}
        \qquad The Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a modelling language using in software engineering to visualize the design of the given system \cite{uml}. It is helpful in communication in company organization and business processes. Version 2.0 of UML includes two main types of diagrams: structural and behavioural.
        Additionally, every type includes several individual and original diagrams. Division has been presented below (based on UML 2.0:in a nutshell \cite{uml}).
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Structural diagrams:
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item class diagrams,
                \item component diagrams,
                \item composite structure diagrams,
                \item deployment diagrams,
                \item package diagrams,
                \item object diagrams.
            \end{enumerate}
            \item Behavioral diagrams:
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item activity diagrams,
                \item communication diagrams,
                \item interaction diagrams,
                \item sequence diagrams,
                \item state machine diagrams,
                \item timing diagrams,
                \item use case diagrams.
            \end{enumerate}
        \end{enumerate}
        
        Some types of diagrams have been presented in next chapters: \ref{structured} and \ref{behavioural} for designed simulator.
        
        
            \subsubsection{Structured models} \label{structured}
            \qquad The structured models are used to present physical organization in your software. For example, it can be relations between objects.
            
            \textbf{Class diagram}
            
            \subsubsection{Behavioural models} \label{behavioural}
            \qquad The behavioural models are used to present actions or behavior of elements. They can be helpful to capture requirements.
            
            \textbf{Use case diagram}
        
        \subsection{Data flow model} \label{data}
        \qquad The Data Flow Diagram (DFD) shows, how data moves in system without details and which kind of data is used. Data flow diagrams are not supported by UML. \cite{models}

    \qquad about documentation
    \qquad about code
    \qquad about test
    \qquad about my results, my simulator and scheduler
    \newline
    \qquad It is important to say that design of simulation tool, quality of code, tests and documentation is not always proper in this case. Complicated design of classes or requirements, which include issues, are sometimes the reason of not delivering each functionality in given time, issues in code and low quality of application. This project is the best exercise, which shows: how to create high quality software and how difficult is it.
